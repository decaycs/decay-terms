# Decay Theme <img src="./assets/main.png" align="right" width="400px"/>
## INFORMATION
Decay uses shades of green along with a dark-toned background for better contrast!

The contrast between background and primary color helps avoiding any eye fatigue when spending a lot of time in front of the computer.

## [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -
To get **Decay Theme** for *Terminator* terminal, you need to dot some I's and cross some T's :|

You need to copy the content of `terminator/decay` into your `~/.config/terminator/config` file under the profiles section.

After you've done that your *Terminator config* file should look something like this:
![Terminator Guide](./assets/terminator_guide.png)

To enable `Decay theme` in terminator you need to right click inside terminal and select the `Decay` profile from the drop-down menu.

To make `Decay theme` default, check out [EliverLara Terminator themes](https://github.com/EliverLara/terminator-themes#setting-a-default)

> See the folder `terminator` to get more versions of decay like `decayce`, `dark-decay` or `light-decay`.

## [Suckless - st](https://st.suckless.org/) -
Getting **Decay Theme** for *st* terminal can be a little bit tricky :|

There are a few approaches to make it work, showing a few for now, but will add extra soon :)

The easiest way is using `xrdb merge` and `path/to/xresources`, in our case you can use:
```
xrdb merge ./st/dark-decay.xresources
```

You can replace `dark-decay` with the appropriate palette that you want. (e.g. `./st/decayce.xresources`)

> This only works using the xresources st patch, for example, we're using the [siduck's st build](https://github.com/siduck/st) that really works nice with this! 

Another way is to edit your `~/.Xresources` file to match the colors of **Decay**

To do so, just copy the content of `./st/xresources` into your `~/.Xresources` file, but make sure to edit the correct section, such as *colors section*

>Note\*: If you use **.Xresources** for your rice colors, then your whole rice will change to **Decay Theme** colors. Be Aware !

## [tym](https://github.com/endaaman/tym) -

To get **Decay Theme** work in *tym* terminal is quite simple, just head over to `tym/` and copy `theme.lua` to your tym terminal config path:

> By default tym terminal config path is `~/.config/tym`

```sh
cp -r decay-terms/tym/theme.lua ~/.config/tym
```

If you just installed tym and don't have any previous *configurations* for tym, you can copy the `config.lua`:

```sh
cp -r decay-terms/tym/config.lua ~/.config/tym
```

or if you do have custom *configurations*, then you just add the content of `tym/config.lua` to your `~/.config/tym/config.lua` file.

> See the folder `tym` to get more versions of decay like `decayce`, `dark-decay` or `light-decay`.

## [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) -
All you need to do is, once again use your favorite keyboard keys, `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` :)

Head over to `wezterm/` and copy the content of `wezterm.lua` under the `return section` into your *wezterm* config file.

> See the folder `wezterm` to get more versions of decay like `decayce`, `dark-decay` or `light-decay`.

## [Xresources](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/x_resources) -
To get the **Decay Theme** in your personal `Xresources` is easy.
Head over the folder `xresources` of the repo, and then copy the file `.Xresources` to your home.

```sh
cd decay-terms/xresources
cp .Xresources ~
```

Now merge the info in your system using `xrdb`:

```sh
xrdb merge ~/.Xresources
```

> See the folder `xresources` to get more versions of decay like `decayce`, `dark-decay` or `light-decay`.

> Is recommended to put this in your autostart, but not in all cases

## [Windows-Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) -
Head over to the settings page, and click `Open JSON file`.
Copy the content of your favourite theme to the `"schemes"`
part of the file.

> See the folder `windows-terminal` to get more versions of decay like `dark-decay` and `light-decay`.

Enable `Decay` by selecting it in the `Appearence` section of your profile in the settings GUI.
